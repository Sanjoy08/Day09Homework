In this assignment, you are required to utilize DOM manipulation. Firstly, I established the specified structure in an HTML file:
Added an input field of type "text." Included an "Add" button. Created an empty div with the ID "para." Following that, I introduced a script file for the JavaScript implementation.
In the JavaScript file, I initiated by retrieving the necessary elements using the getElementById method. Subsequently, 
I established an event using the addEventListener method, utilizing the "click" event type. Within this event, 
I generated a p element utilizing the createElement method to contain the text. 
This newly created element is then appended using the appendChild method.
